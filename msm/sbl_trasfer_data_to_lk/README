Question: How to customize SMEM items for OEM use?
Answer: OEM cannot add new SMEM items by themselves but OEM can use predefined SMEM items 
instead.
Details:
- Complete list of SMEM IDs can be found in \modem_proc\core\api\mproc\smem_type.h
- SMEM item definitions(smem_mem_type enum) has to be consistent across all the processors.
- Qualcomm predefined below enums(IDs) for OEM use. so OEM can use below enums(IDs) for OEM use.
SMEM_ID_VENDOR0
SMEM_ID_VENDOR1
SMEM_ID_VENDOR2
- If OEM needs more than above three, please contact Qualcomm. please note this may take excessive time 
as it requires Qualcomm Software architecture team review.
- if new SMEM items is approved, it will always be appended to the end of the enum list. Inserting an item in
the middle is prohibited.
